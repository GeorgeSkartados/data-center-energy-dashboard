# Data Center Energy & COâ‚‚ Dashboard

This project models global data center energy consumption and carbon emissions under different renewable adoption scenarios (baseline vs. 80% renewables).  

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore regional energy use and COâ‚‚ emissions.  
- Modeled renewable adoption scenario â†’ showed potential **70% reduction in emissions**.  
- Identified **top 5 emitting regions** and highlighted opportunities for energy transition.  
- Designed with both technical and non-technical stakeholders in mind.  

## ðŸš€ Files in this Repo
- `DataCenter_Energy.pbix` â†’ Full Power BI dashboard  
- `DataCenter_Energy.pdf` â†’ PDF export of dashboard for quick viewing  
- `data_center_energy.csv` â†’ Sample dataset used  

## ðŸ’¡ Business Question
How can data centers worldwide reduce their carbon footprint through renewable energy adoption?  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- Transitioning to 80% renewables can cut emissions by up to 70%.  
- Asia and North America emerge as the top emitters, driving the need for urgent action.  
- A clear roadmap for both **business leaders** and **policy teams** to target sustainability goals.
